<p>In ghostlore, a haunted house or ghosthouse is a house or other building often perceived as being inhabited by
disembodied spirits of the deceased who may have been former residents or were familiar with the property.
Parapsychologists attribute haunting to the spirits of the dead and the effect of violent or tragic events in the
building's past such as murder, accidental death, or suicide.</p>

<p>Legends about haunted houses have long appeared in literature. The earliest surviving report of a haunted house comes
from a letter written by Pliny the Younger to his patron Lucias Sura, in which he describes a haunted villa in Athens.
Nobody would live in the house until the philosopher Athenodorus arrived in the city. He was tempted by the low rent
and undeterred by the house's reputation so he moved in. The ghost, an old man bound with chains, appeared to Athenodrus
during the first night, and beckoned to the philosopher. The apparition vanished once it reached the courtyard, and
Athenodrus carefully marked the spot. The following morning he requested the magistrate to have the spot dug up, where
the skeleton of an old man bound with chains was discovered. The ghost never appeared again after the skeleton was
given a proper burial.</p>
