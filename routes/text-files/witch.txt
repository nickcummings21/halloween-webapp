<p>Witchcraft or witchery broadly means the practice of and belief in magical skills and abilities exercised by solitary
practitioners and groups. Witchcraft is a broad term that varies culturally and societally, and thus can be difficult
to define with precision, and cross-cultural assumptions about the meaning or significance of the term should be
applied with caution. Witchcraft often occupies a religious divinatory or medicinal role, and is often present
within societies and groups whose cultural framework includes a magical world view.</p>

<p>The concept of witchcraft and the belief in its existence have persisted throughout recorded history. They have been
present or central at various times and in many diverse forms among cultures and religions worldwide, including both
"primitive" and "highly advanced" cultures, and continue to have an important role in many cultures today.</p>
