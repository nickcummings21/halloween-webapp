<p>Trick-or-treating is a Halloween ritual custom for children and adults in many countries. Children in costumes travel
from house to house, asking for treats with the phrase "Trick or treat". The "treat" is usually some form of candy,
although in some cultures money is used instead. The "trick" refers to a threat, usually idle, to perform mischief on
the homeowners or their property if no treat is given. Trick-or-treating usually occurs on the evening of October 31.
Some homeowners signal that they are willing to hand out treats by putting up Halloween decorations outside their doors;
others simply leave treats available on their porches for the children to take freely.</p>

<p>Traditions similar to the modern custom of trick-or-treating extend all the way back to classical antiquity, although
it is extremely unlikely that any of them are directly related to the modern custom. The ancient Greek writer Athenaeus
of Naucratis records in his book The Deipnosophists that, in ancient times, the Greek island of Rhodes had a custom in
which children would go from door-to-door dressed as swallows, singing a song, which demanded the owners of the house
to give them food and threatened to cause mischief if the owners of the house refused.</p>

<p>The custom of trick-or-treating on Halloween may come from the belief that supernatural beings, or the souls of the
dead, roamed the earth at this time and needed to be appeased.</p>
