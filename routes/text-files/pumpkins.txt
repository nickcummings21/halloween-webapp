<p>A jack-o'-lantern (or jack o'lantern) is a carved pumpkin, turnip, or other root vegetable lantern, associated with
the holiday of Halloween and named after the phenomenon of a strange light flickering over peat bogs, called
will-o'-the-wisp or jack-o'-lantern. Its name is also tied to the Irish legend of Stingy Jack, a drunkard who bargains
with Satan and is doomed to roam the Earth with only a hollowed turnip to light his way.</p>
