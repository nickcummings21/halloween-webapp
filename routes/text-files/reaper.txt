<p>Death, due to its prominent place in human culture, is frequently imagined as a personified force, also known as the
Grim Reaper. In some mythologies, the Grim Reaper causes the victim's death by coming to collect them. In turn, people
in some stories try to hold on to life by avoiding Death's visit, or by fending Death off with bribery or tricks. Other
beliefs hold that the Spectre of Death is only a psychopomp, serving to sever the last ties between the soul and the
body, and to guide the deceased to the afterlife, without having any control over when or how the victim dies.</p>
