<p>In folklore, a ghost (sometimes known as an apparition, haunt, phantom, poltergeist, shade, specter or spectre, spirit,
spook, and wraith) is the soul or spirit of a dead person or animal that can appear to the living. In ghostlore,
descriptions of ghosts vary widely from an invisible presence to translucent or barely visible wispy shapes, to
realistic, lifelike visions. The deliberate attempt to contact the spirit of a deceased person is known as necromancy,
or in spiritism as a séance.</p>

<p>The belief in the existence of an afterlife, as well as manifestations of the spirits of the dead, is widespread, dating
back to animism or ancestor worship in pre-literate cultures. Certain religious practices—funeral rites, exorcisms, and
some practices of spiritualism and ritual magic—are specifically designed to rest the spirits of the dead. Ghosts are
generally described as solitary, human-like essences, though stories of ghostly armies and the ghosts of animals rather
than humans have also been recounted. They are believed to haunt particular locations, objects, or people they were
associated with in life.</p>
