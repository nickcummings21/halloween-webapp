<p>A mummy is a deceased human or an animal whose skin and organs have been preserved by either intentional or accidental
exposure to chemicals, extreme cold, very low humidity, or lack of air, so that the recovered body does not decay
further if kept in cool and dry conditions. Some authorities restrict the use of the term to bodies deliberately
embalmed with chemicals, but the use of the word to cover accidentally desiccated bodies goes back to at least 1615 AD.</p>

<p>Mummies are commonly featured in horror genres as undead creatures wrapped in bandages.
One of the earliest examples of undead mummies is The Mummy!: Or a Tale of the Twenty-Second Century, an 1827 novel
written by Jane C. Loudon. This early science-fiction work concerns an Egyptian mummy named Cheops, who is brought back
to life in the 22nd century.</p>
