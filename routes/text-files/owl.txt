<p>The mysterious, beautiful owl is a bird worth studying. It flies by night and it has an uncanny ability to capture
prey. But because these birds are night-fliers, humans have often feared them. Many societies and cultures associate
them with darkness, negativity, and mystery while others associated them with wisdom and prophecy.</p>

<p>In general, owls are viewed as harbingers of bad luck, ill health, or death. The belief is widespread even today.</p>
