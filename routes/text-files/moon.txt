<p>Full moons are traditionally associated with temporal insomnia (inability to sleep), insanity (hence the terms lunacy
and lunatic) and various "magical phenomena" such as lycanthropy.</p>

<p>The "harvest moon" and "hunter's moon" are traditional terms for the full moons occurring during late summer and in the
autumn, in the northern hemisphere usually in September and October respectively. The "harvest moon" is the full moon
closest to the autumnal equinox (22 or 23 September), coming anywhere from two weeks before to two weeks after that
date. The "hunter's moon" is the full moon following it. The names are recorded from the early 18th century. The Oxford
English Dictionary entry for "harvest moon" cites a 1706 reference, and for "hunter's moon" a 1710 edition of The
British Apollo, where the term is attributed to "the country people". The names became traditional in American folklore,
where they are now often popularly attributed to the Native Americans.</p>
