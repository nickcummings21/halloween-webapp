<p>In folklore, a werewolf (Old English: werwulf, "man-wolf") or occasionally lycanthrope is a human with the ability
to shapeshift into a wolf (or, especially in modern film, a therianthropic hybrid wolflike creature), either purposely
or after being placed under a curse or affliction (often a bite or scratch from another werewolf).</p>

<p>The beliefs classed together under lycanthropy are far from uniform, and the term is somewhat capriciously applied.
The transformation may be temporary or permanent; the were-animal may be the man himself metamorphosed; may be his
double whose activity leaves the real man to all appearance unchanged; may be his soul, which goes forth seeking
whomever it may devour, leaving its body in a state of trance; or it may be no more than the messenger of the human
being, a real animal or a familiar spirit, whose intimate connection with its owner is shown by the fact that any
injury to it is believed, by a phenomenon known as repercussion, to cause a corresponding injury to the human being.</p>
