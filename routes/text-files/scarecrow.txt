<p>A scarecrow is a decoy or mannequin, often in the shape of a human. Humanoid scarecrows are usually dressed in old
clothes and placed in open fields to discourage birds from disturbing and feeding on recently cast seed and growing
crops. Scarecrows are used across the world by farmers, and are a notable symbol of farms and the countryside in
popular culture.</p>
