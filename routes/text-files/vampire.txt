<p>A vampire is a being from folklore that subsists by feeding on the vital force (generally in the form of blood) of the
living. In European folklore, vampires were undead beings that often visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths in
the neighbourhoods they inhabited when they were alive. They wore shrouds and were often described as bloated and of
ruddy or dark countenance, markedly different from today's gaunt, pale vampire which dates from the early 19th century.</p>

<p>Count Dracula is the title character of Bram Stoker's 1897 gothic horror novel Dracula. He is
considered to be both the prototypical and the archetypal vampire in subsequent works of fiction. He is also depicted
in the novel to be the origin of werewolf legends. Some aspects of the character are believed to have been inspired
by the 15th-century Wallachian Prince Vlad the Impaler, who was also known as Dracula.</p>
