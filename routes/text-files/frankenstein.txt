<p>Frankenstein's monster, often erroneously referred to as "Frankenstein", is a fictional character who first appeared in
Mary Shelley's 1818 novel Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus. Shelley's title thus compares the monster's creator,
Victor Frankenstein, to the mythological character Prometheus, who fashioned humans out of clay and gave them fire.</p>

<p>In Shelley's Gothic story, Victor Frankenstein builds the creature in his laboratory through an ambiguous method
consisting of chemistry and alchemy. Shelley describes the monster as 8-foot-tall (2.4 m), hideously ugly, but sensitive
and emotional. The monster attempts to fit into human society but is shunned, which leads him to seek revenge against
Frankenstein. According to the scholar Joseph Carroll, the monster occupies "a border territory between the
characteristics that typically define protagonists and antagonists".</p>
