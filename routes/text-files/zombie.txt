<p>A zombie is a fictional undead being created through the reanimation of a human corpse. The term comes from Haitian
folklore, where a zombie is a dead body reanimated through various methods, most commonly magic. Modern depictions of
the reanimation of the dead do not necessarily involve magic but often invoke science fictional methods such as
carriers, radiation, mental diseases, vectors, pathogens, scientific accidents, etc.</p>
